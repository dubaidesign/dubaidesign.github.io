## Search Engine Optimization Dubai

As a freelance SEO (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">Search Engine Optimization</a>), I'm able to help you improve your Google rankings, by adding the right content and by improving your technical SEO. No matter if you're doing local SEO in Jumeirah or Downtown Dubai.

For a page to be found in Googles search results for revenue-generating keywords, you need a good user experience, proper added value and a technically flawless page. Link recommendations in the form of a backlink are not to be despised here, but in a natural and not purchased or exchanged way. I offer these services as [Freelance Web Designer Dubai](/).

If the website is informative and of high quality, other web portals will gladly and voluntarily link to it. Exactly that must be the highest goal with the lasting search machine optimization. This way, customers and service providers do not have to fear Google updates, but can even look forward to them.

My search engine optimization consists of on-page SEO, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_marketing" target="_blank">content marketing</a>, link audit and monitoring.

## On-Page SEO

To enhance ranking, click behavior, and usability, direct measures are implemented on the website. This involves optimizing both technical aspects, such as load time, crawling, and indexing, as well as visual elements, such as keywords, page structure, and snippets.

In my work we put emphasis on preparing a detailed strategy of action. In order to prepare it according to the individual needs of the Client, at the very beginning I have to determine what are our goals and where do we start. That is why I perform SEO audit, thanks to which I receive answers to the most important questions.

If you have a website for the local market of Dubai or UAE, my SEO audit will cost less than if it is a small website or a store for the whole country. SEO audit precedes all further activities performed by me within website positioning. These are multi-faceted and multi-stage actions. SEO optimization includes primarily checking such issues as:

* technical situation of the website
* results in searches for popular phrases
* results in searches for specific phrases
* popularity of the page in the internet
* competitive advantages and disadvantages
* situation in the industry
