## On-Page SEO

To enhance ranking, click behavior, and usability, direct measures are implemented on the website. This involves optimizing both technical aspects, such as load time, crawling, and indexing, as well as visual elements, such as keywords, page structure, and snippets.

In my work I put emphasis on preparing a detailed strategy for your business and your website. In the beginning I determine our goals and then a clear roadmap to achieve these goals. That is why I also perform SEO audits, thanks to which I receive answers to the most important questions.

The cost of my SEO audit for your website will vary depending on its size and target market. If your website caters to the local market of Dubai or UAE, the cost of the audit will be lower compared to if it is a small website or an online store targeting a larger audience, such as the entire country.

An SEO audit is the first step I take when working on a website's search engine optimization. The optimization process is really important for your website and your local business in Dubai. The audit focuses mainly on reviewing the following:

* Technical situation of the website
* Results in searches for popular phrases
* Results in searches for specific phrases
* Popularity of the page in the internet
* Competitive advantages and disadvantages
* Situation in the industry (Dubai market etc.)
