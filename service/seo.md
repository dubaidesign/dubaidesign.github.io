Search Engine Optimization



SEO PodestFor a portal to be found in the search results for revenue-generating keywords, you need a good user experience, proper added value and a technically flawless page. Link recommendations in the form of a backlink are not to be despised here, but in a natural and not purchased or exchanged way.

If the website is informative and of high quality, other web portals will gladly and voluntarily link to it. Exactly that must be the highest goal with the lasting search machine optimization. This way, customers and service providers do not have to fear Google updates, but can even look forward to them.

Our search engine optimization consists of onpage, content marketing, link audit and monitoring.


## On-Page SEO

Here, measures are taken directly on the website to improve ranking, click behavior and usability. This is achieved by optimizing technical factors (load time, crawling, indexing, ...) and visual factors (keywords, page structure, snippets, ...).
