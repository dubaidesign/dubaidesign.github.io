<h2 id="more-about-my-services">More about my Services</h2>

<p>I offer a comprehensive implementation of websites, starting from graphics, through CMS administration panel to individually prepared modules.</p>

<p>When designing and implementing the site I strongly rely on:</p>

<h3 id="mobility-of-the-website">Mobility of the website</h3>
<p>Building them on the basis of RWD (Responsive Web Design) ensuring the availability and proper functioning of the site on smartphones, tablets and high-resolution monitors.</p>

<h3 id="search-engine-optimization">Search engine optimization</h3>
<p>Adequate page structure, the use of appropriate texts from the homepage and correct internal linking form a good basis for developing the full potential of the subsequent positioning.</p>

<h3 id="wide-range-of-edibility">Wide range of edibility</h3>
<p>Starting from menu structure, through subpage content, but also animated headers, all these elements and many others are fully editable from the administration panel. So that the expansion of the site can follow the needs and do not require IT assistance.</p>
