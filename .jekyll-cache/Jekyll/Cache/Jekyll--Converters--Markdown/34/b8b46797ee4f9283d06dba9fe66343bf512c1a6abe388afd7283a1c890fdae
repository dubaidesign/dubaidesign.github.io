<p class="italic">I am an experienced web designer from the San Francisco Bay area. I work with start-ups, freelancers, designers and app developers. Needless to say San Francisco is a melting pot with new ideas, new projects and apps that are being developed that will change our daily life. </p>
<p>That’s the reason I am so excited to design and develop websites for these kind of projects.</p>

<p>Located in the Upper Market area, I am able to work with my customers locally and online. I meet my customers for a coffee at market street or I visit startups at any San Francisco area.</p>

<p>I build this page to give you all the information about my web design related services and my current project.</p>

<h2 id="front-end-development-including-javascript-gatsbyjs-and-jekyll">Front End Development including JavaScript, GatsbyJS and Jekyll.</h2>

<p>I code with JavaScript, I develop extrmely fast GatsbyJS pages and I love to creating simple pags with my favourite static site generator: Jekyll.</p>
